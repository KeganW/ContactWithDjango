README
PURPOSE: Learn django, get some familiarity and experience in working with databases and backend logic. 
Display code that will work for one of my website pages (the contact form). This ultimately takes in 
user input, and inserts each element in a database. Basic error checking included.

WORK: Under contact, edits in settings.py and urls.py. Under contactMe, admin.py, apps.py, models.py, urls.py, 
and views.py. Under static, style.css. Under templates, contacts.html.j2.

MOTIVATION: Want to improve my exposure to backend design so I can eventually integrate both frontend and 
backend cohesively.
